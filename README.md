**Prof. Note** --> check the density of the co-expressed networks, for easily find the hubs is important to have graphs not highly dense. Because, this means that the hubs are connected with every node (with a higher probability), so pick a threshold higher than 0.55, but not too much... 0.65 maybe is better to recognize the hubs
